## Stage One: make it work
I only want to make it work. If it generate results. Cheers~
## Stage Two: make it reuseful
## Stage Three: make it pluggable
## Stage Four: code is serving for thinking
Before coding, even a tiny system, there are more things that need to do that can take more than few hours, even days. Coding is not the basic content of this section. Thinking is. Everything, like a function, a variable name, building from a blueprint. The base arch matsters the final project. Code is just a tool to make the thought run.
